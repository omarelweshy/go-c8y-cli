## Overview

Extensions allow you to customize go-c8y-cli to optimize you and your team's workflows. You can customize how your data is displayed and provide custom commands to simplify repetitive tasks.

Extensions utilize existing go-c8y-cli features and packages them so they are easy to install and share. This makes it easy for a team to collaborate to add new commands for custom microservices, or just add custom columns to the device view so you can display new custom managed object fragments by default.

By default extensions are accessible across all sessions. Though for scenarios where you would like to limit an extension to a single session or a group of sessions you can change the folder where the extensions are stored based on customer or some other task orientated grouping.
